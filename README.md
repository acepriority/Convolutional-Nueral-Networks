# Convolutional-Nueral-Networks
![PyTorch Logo](pytorch_logo.png)

This repository contains various Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) implemented using PyTorch. Each network is implemented in a separate Python file. The following CNNs are included:

1. `LeNet.py`: Implementation of the LeNet-5 architecture, one of the pioneering CNN models.

2. `VGG.py`: Implementation of the VGG (Visual Geometry Group) network, which is known for its simplicity and effectiveness.

3. `InceptionNet.py`: Implementation of the InceptionNet architecture, famous for its use of inception modules that help capture multi-scale features efficiently.

4. `ResNet.py`: Implementation of the ResNet (Residual Network) architecture, which introduced residual connections to enable the training of deeper networks.

5. `EffecientNet.py`: Implementation of the EfficientNet model, which achieves state-of-the-art performance with a focus on achieving better accuracy and efficiency trade-offs.
